/* 
TO DO: 
- GET /notes should return the notes.html file.
- GET * should return the index.html file.
- The following API routes should be created:
    - GET /api/notes should read the db.json file and 
        return all saved notes as JSON.
    - POST /api/notes should receive a new note to save on the 
        request body, add it to the db.json file, and then return the 
        new note to the client. You'll need to find a way to give each 
        note a unique id when it's saved (look into npm packages that 
        could do this for you).
    - DELETE /api/notes/:id should receive a query parameter that contains 
        the id of a note to delete. To delete a note, you'll need to read all 
        notes from the db.json file, remove the note with the given id property, 
        and then rewrite the notes to the db.json file.

-GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page

WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the noteâ€™s text in the right-hand column

WHEN I enter a new note title and the noteâ€™s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page

WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes

WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column

WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the noteâ€™s text in the right-hand column
